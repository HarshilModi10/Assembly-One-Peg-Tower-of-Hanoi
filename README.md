# Assembly-One-Peg-Tower-of-Hanoi

This repository contains source code for **Single Peg Towers of Hanoi** final project of SFWR 2XA3 at McMaster University.
The objective of the project was to code a recursive solution using NASM assembly code while meeting several specifications. The solution must use arrays, be assembled with a Makefile and display the configuration after every iteration.
The class (SFWR 2XA3) was an experiential learning course in **Unix, Bash, NASM and command line tools**.
